Project Description

Based on the backgrounds and interests of the group members, we would like to explore trends in the equity investment market by using historical US stock market information as a proxy. The goal is to perform analysis that would answer the following questions

1. How has the composition of stocks by industry changed over time?
2. If we are to select a stock by industry at random, what are the chances that it has positive return? Which industry should we invest in for the most return? 
If we pick the top 5 expensive stock in this industry, What is the monthly return over the period for these 5 stocks? Is there any Seasonality for the monthend close price? Is there autocorrelation of the monthend close prices of each of the 5 stocks? Visualize the correlation between the returns of all pairs of stocks. 
3. What are the daily and monthly price changes at individual stock and industry level?
4. Is there a linear correlation between volatility of prices to overall return?
5. Is there a correlation between days of loss until a day of positive return?
6. Based on each historical return for the past 10 years, which company (if any) has remained in the top 10? Top 5?
7. Was there a change in the top 5 industries (GICS sectors) in the past 10 years?
